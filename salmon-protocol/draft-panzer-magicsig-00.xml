      <t>NOTE: This -00 draft has been superseded by draft-panzer-magicsig-01.  Please remove
      references to this draft, other than historical ones.</t>
      <t>This document defines a lightweight, robust mechanism for digitally signing nearly 
         arbitrary messages,
         along with a basic public key infrastructure for discovering the signing keys.</t>
      <t>It is intended to be a building block in the construction of other protocols, providing
         a commonly agreed upon abstraction layer on top of lower level protocols such as 
         <xref target="LRDD">Webfinger/LRDD</xref>, <xref target="XRD">XRD</xref>, 
         and <xref target="RFC3447">PKCS</xref>.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The primary goal of Magic Signatures is to enable lightweight and robust public key signing 
         for messages that may be transformed, converted, stored, and reconstituted in arbitrary ways.  
         In order to make this mechanism useful, it also defines a public key discovery protocol that enables 
         recipients to reliably map between pseudonyms for authors and their corresponding public keys.</t>
      <t>This mechanism is an alternative to XML-DSig.  In the field, XML-DSig has proven to be problematic
         in applications such as syndication of feeds.  Compared to XML-DSig, Magic Signatures offers 
         the following features:
         <list style="numbers"><t>Can handle any data format; not tied to XML.</t><t>Does not require any canonicalization beyond removal of whitespace, so it is much easier
              to verify messages correctly.</t><t>Can survive message disassembly, storage into arbitrary systems, and 
              re-constitution without invalidating the signature.</t><t>Significantly smaller and simpler specification.</t></list>
         Magic Signatures does not attempt to address every XML-DSig use case, so it is best
         described as a lightweight, robust, and minimal form of digital signatures that can be used
         and deployed where XML-DSig cannot be relied on.  Note that for XML, it is possible to combine both 
         mechanisms.

    <section title="Magic Envelope Definition">
      <t>A "Magic Envelope" comprises a message bundled along with a signature for that message, expressed
      as a series of parameters, and serialized as either XML or JSON.  The envelope specifies the data
      to be signed, the MIME type of the data, the transfer encoding, and the signature.</t>
      <section title="Magic Envelope Parameters" anchor="params">
        <t>
        This section describes the semantics of the parameters which are serializion-independent.
        <list style="hanging"><t hangText="data:">The payload covered by the signature, encoded into an ASCII string.  
          This string is guaranteed to be safe to include without escaping as XML text
          and in JSON strings.</t><t hangText="data_type:">The <xref target="RFC2045">MIME</xref> type of the payload prior to encoding.</t><t hangText="encoding:">The encoding used to convert between the MIME type and the "data" string.
          In this specification, encoding MUST be the string "base64url", indicating the url safe base64
          encoding as described in <xref target="RFC4648">RFC 4648</xref>.  All
          implementations MUST support this encoding.</t><t hangText="alg:">The algorithm used for the signature.  This specification describes only one 
          signature algorithm, "RSA-SHA256", which all implementations MUST support.</t>
        <t hangText="sig:">A generated signature.  This is a string in the base64url encoded format as described
          above.  It is generated according to "Signing Messages" [ref], and verified according to 
          "Verifying Messages" [ref].  A Magic Envelope has one or more
          signatures.  Each signature has exactly one associated "keyhash"
          parameter.</t>
        <t hangText="keyhash:">A key identifier attached to each generated
          signature (sig).  A keyhash is the base64url-encoded SHA256 hash of the public signing key's
          magicsig representation.  It is used to fingerprint exactly which of
          several possible keys were used to produce the associated signature
          string.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="The XML Serialization">
        <t>A Magic Envelope XML Document is defined in terms of the XML Information Set, 
        serialized as XML 1.0 [W3C.REC-xml-20040204] and identified with the 
        "application/magic-envelope+xml" media type. Magic Envelope XML Documents MUST be 
        well-formed XML. This specification does not define a DTD, and thus does not require validity 
        (in the sense used by XML).</t>
        <t>When used as a standalone XML document, the root element MUST be me:env.  When incorporated
        as a subtree of another XML document, the root of the subtree MAY be either me:env or me:provenance.
        The me:provenance form indicates that the data is intended for verification of its sibling DOM nodes; 
        the me:env form merely adds a signed envelope to the DOM without implying any particular semantics.</t>
        <t>The parameters are mapped to XML elements and attributes as follows.  Each parameter MUST appear
        exactly once per envelope.</t>
        <t><list style="hanging"><t hangText="The &lt;me:data&gt; element (REQUIRED):">Contains the "data" payload, an ASCII string, as 
            described in
            <xref target="params"/>.  The element contains one REQUIRED attribute, "type",
            which contains the value of the "data_type" parameter.
        </t><t hangText="The &lt;me:encoding&gt; element (REQUIRED):">Contains the value of the "encoding" parameter.</t><t hangText="The &lt;me:alg&gt; element (REQUIRED):">Contains the value of the "alg" parameter.</t>
        <t hangText="The &lt;me:sig&gt; element (REQUIRED):">Contains the value
          of the "sig" parameter, an ASCII string.  MAY be repeated multiple
          times to record multiple signatures over the same text.  MUST have a keyhash
          attribute containing the "keyhash" value for the signature.</t>
      </list>
        Additional elements not defined by this specification MAY appear as children of the me:env
        or me:provenance elements, but MUST NOT appear as children of any other element.  Processors MUST ignore
        elements they do not understand.</t>

      <t>A Magic Envelope JSON data structure may be embedded within any JSON structure.  When this is done

      <t>The application/magic-envelope+{atom,json} data structures MAY be used standalone, as a drop-in replacement
      for the data that is encoded in the data element.  This would be appropriate where the recipient understands 
      the Magic Envelope specification and can automatically decode the data to recover the original format.
      For example, instead of POSTing an application/atom+xml type entry to create a new blog post, a client
      could POST an application/magic-envelope+xml with data of type application/atom+xml.</t>
      <section title="Syndicating Magic Envelope Messages">
        <t>It may be useful to syndicate Atom entries which have been enveloped and signed.  This can be done in
        two ways:  By adding a me:provenance element to the existing Atom entry and essentially duplicating
        its content in a signed me:data element, or by completely replacing each signed Atom entry with the
        corresponding me:env element.</t>
        <t>Feed processors who understand Magic Signatures SHOULD treat me:env elements which verify correctly
        as if the underlying Atom entry had been sent.  The semantics of me:env elements whose signatures cannot
        be verified are undefined by this specification; processors MAY ignore them, produce an error, attach a
        warning, or perform other actions as required by their security model.

    <section title="Encoding of data and sig using base64url" anchor="encoding">
      <t>The data and sig fields of a Magic Envelope are encoded as armored ASCII strings using
      a procedure chosen to be robust in the face of various types of transports and storage systems.
      Specifically, the encoded form is safe to include directly as text in XML, a string in JSON, 
      a parameter in URLs, or as form data, without escaping.  This section defines the mapping between 
      arbitrary binary data (a stream of octets) and the armored form (an ASCII string). 
      The ASCII string is also chosen so as to be a valid and equivalent UTF-8 string.</t>
      <section title="Encoding" anchor="encoding_details">
        <t>
          The basic procedure is to use the URL and Filename safe variant of the base64 encoding as described in
          <xref target="RFC4648">RFC 4648</xref>, section 5, hereafter known as
          "base64url" encoding.
          The result is a string that consists only of the ASCII alphanumeric characters along with
          '-' and '_', and possibly '='.  In regular expression form, this is
          "^[A-Za-z0-9\-_]*=?=?=?$".  This is the normalized
          form of the encoded data, and is the basis for the octet sequence that is used to generate the digital
          signature.  Implementations and transports MAY add arbitrary whitespace (ASCII values 0x09-0x0D and 0x20) 
          anywhere in this string after signing but before output so as to, e.g., comply with line length 
          restrictions in certain environments.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Decoding">
        <t>
          The basic procedure is the reverse of encoding, with the additional step that whitespace from the
          input should be ignored.  This is necessary for robustness because some transports may insert
          whitespace, and is useful to allow for human readable formatting of documents in any case.
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Normalize the string by removing all whitespace characters from input.</t>

        private signing key and M is the message string given below.</t>
      <t>M is produced by concatenating the
        following substrings together, separated by periods (ASCII 0x2E):
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>The armored string for "data" produced by <xref
              target="encoding_details"/></t>
          <t>The Base64url encoding of the "data_type" parameter</t>
          <t>The Base64url encoding of the "encoding" parameter</t>
          <t>The Base64url encoding of the "alg" parameter</t>
        </list>
        For example, if the
        armored data is "Tm90IHJlYWxseSBBdG9t" with MIME type
        application/atom+xml, then m would be the string:
        "Tm90IHJlYWxseSBBdG9t.YXBwbGljYXRpb24vYXRvbSt4bWw=.YmFzZTY0dXJs.UlNBLVNIQTI1Ng=="
      </t>
      <t>For convenience we
        summarize the steps for the required EMSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with RSA-SHA256
        algorithm here.  In
        the following, '+' means string concatenation.
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Let hash = the SHA256 hash digest of M</t>
          <t>Let prefix = the constant byte sequence
          <cref anchor="NOTE1" source="JP">The octets are Elvish, of an ancient
          mode, but the language is that of ASN.1, which I will not utter here.
          But this in the Common Tongue is what is said, close enough:</cref>
            [0x30, 0x31,
            0x30, 0xd, 0x6,
            0x9, 0x60, 0x86, 0x48, 0x1, 0x65, 0x3, 0x4, 0x2, 0x1, 0x5, 0x0, 0x4,
            0x20]</t>
          <t>Let k = the number of bytes in the public key modulus</t>
          <t>Let padding = '\xFF' repeated (k - length(prefix+hash) - 3)
            times</t>
          <t>Let emsa =  '\x00' + '\x01' + padding + '\x00' + prefix + hash</t>
          <t>RSA sign the emsa byte sequence</t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>The signature is then encoded as in <xref target="encoding_details"/> and the resulting ASCII armored string
      stored as a "sig" signature.  The associated "keyhash" is the base64url
      encoded respresentation of the SHA-256 hash of public key's application/magic-key
      representation.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Verifying Messages" anchor="verifying">
      <t>Verifying a message signature consists of verifying that "sig" is a valid signature for "data" using "alg".
      This specification defines only the "RSA-SHA256" verification algorithm, meaning the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 
      verification algorithm from <xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref> section 8.2.1.</t>
      <t>The verification is performed by executing RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5-VERIFY
        ((n, e), M, S), where (n ,e)
        comprise the public key, M is the message string
        documented in <xref target="signing"/>,
        and S is the decoded value of a selected "sig".  (Note that this
        algorithm creates the emsa byte sequence as in <xref target="signing"/>
        and then performing RSA verification using (n, e), emsa, and S.)</t>
      <t>The scope of the verification covers only the contents of the Magic Envelope itself.  In some
      cases, e.g., when using envelope data as provenance for enclosing data, the decoded "data" value
      must be checked against or override the enclosing data.  A secure if lossy mechanism
      is to throw away the enclosing information and replace it with the output of the decoded "data".
      Another alternative is to compare trees, override with signed information where there are conflicts,
      and annotate signed parts.  The correct mechanism depends on the security model required by the processor
      and is outside the scope of this specification.</t>
      <t>The public key (n, e) is obtained using the simple public key infrastructure described by 
      <xref target="spki"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Simple Public Key Infrastructure" anchor="spki">
      <t>This section defines a public key infrastructure based on URI discovery, as defined in [ref LRDD].
      Specifically, given a URI such as "acct:bob@example.com" or "http://example.com/bob", the corresponding 
      public key(s) for that identifier can be found via Webfinger/LRDD discovery for links of type rel="magic-public-key".  
      This specification defines a new MIME type for simple RSA public key(pairs).</t>
      <section title="The application/magic-key MIME type">
        <t>The application/magic-key format is a very minimal format for representing public key data.
        It consists of a string of ASCII text, separated into 3 components, with components separated 
        by a "." (0x2E) character.  The first component is the key type; this specification only defines
        the "RSA" key type for future upgradeability.  Thus a magic key consists of the string 
        "RSA.modulus(n).exponent(e)"
        The pair (n, e) is used as input to RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5-VERIFY.</t>
        <t>Each of the components is first represented as an integer in network byte order (big endian) and
        encoded via the "base64url" mechanism described in <xref target="params"/>.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Discovery">
        <t>This section defines how to map from a URI based identifier to a public signing key for that 
        identifier.  Though the exact mechanism for a verifier to determine the identifier of the signer
        is outside the scope of this specification, the identifier MUST appear within the "data" parameter
        and therefore be covered by the signature, and the public key ultimately
        discovered using the identifier MUST hash to the "keyhash" parameter
        associated with the signature.  (Note that the latter requirement is
        is for efficiency rather than security.)
        Many existing formats contain authorship or sender
        fields and these SHOULD be used or extended.  Specifications which rely on this one for digital
        signatures MUST specify a format-dependent model for determining
        potential signer URIs given the signed data.
        This specification describes the subsequent step:
        How to take a general URI and map it to a public signing key.
        </t>
        <t>Given an identifier such as acct:bob@example.com or http://example.org/, first perform discovery
          per <xref target="LRDD">Webfinger/LRDD</xref>.  Once an XRD for the identifier is located, retrieve the href value(s) for
          all links with rel="magic-public-key".  Each identified resource is a valid public signing key.</t>
        <t>Note that the data: URI scheme MAY be used, so that a public key can be embedded completely within
        an XRD file (and covered by its security).  Alternatively the key can be
        stored elsewhere and retrieved via a secure connection.</t>
        <t>Among the keys found, select the key to use for verification by using
          the one whose SHA-256 hash matches the "keyhash" parameter of the
          signature being processed.  Note that it is possible for one signature
          to be verified but others to fail, and for only one of several
          potential signers to actually have a verified signature.
          Specifications which rely on this one MUST specify the semantics in
          these cases.</t>
